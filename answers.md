- **1a.**
  The maximum depth is $O(\log_d n)$.

- **1b.**
  The work done in the insert operation is $O(\log_d n)$ because only one swap is done at each level.
  The work done in delete is $O(d \log_d n)$ because there are d comparisons made to find the minimum amount of childeren, and a possible swap.

- **1c.**
  $O(d|V|\log_d|V| + |E|\log_d|V|)$ where the first term represents the mimimun work of the delete operation, and the second term is the work of the insert operation.
  
- **1d.**
  $O(|E|/|V|)$ gives us the running time we want to achieve.
